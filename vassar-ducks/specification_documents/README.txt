This folder contains diagrams & specification documents regarding our Duck App.
Class Diagram (Original) is our original class diagram from before when we started working on the code--
it is now not entirely indicative of the way we ended up implementing the program.

Class Diagram (Updated) is our updated file with irrelevant classes removed from the diagram, and more objects
added that were not originally planned but ended up getting implemented as we realized they made sense
for the structure of our program. Note that these removed classes are still present in our final code, but are not
referenced by the DuckApp--further iterations of this app could include them, though.

InteractionDiagram is a representation of the interactions between different parts of our code.
